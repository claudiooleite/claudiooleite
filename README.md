# Hello! üëã

I'm Cl√°udio Leite, a passionate front-end developer with a knack for creating dynamic and user-friendly web applications.

## My Journey üöÄ

I began my coding journey seven months ago, diving into the Odin Project's Foundations course. This rigorous program gave me a solid grounding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through hands-on projects and an incredibly supportive community.

To further hone my skills, I pursued the **Meta Front-End Professional Certification**. This comprehensive course advanced my knowledge, covering modern frameworks and advanced topics. I became proficient in React, state management, and responsive design. One highlight was building the Little Lemon Restaurant Web App, a project that tested and showcased my skills comprehensively. You can explore this and other projects on my profile.

## What's Next? üåü

I am eager to embrace new challenges and opportunities that leverage my front-end development skills. I'm particularly interested in roles involving:
- Intuitive and accessible user interfaces
- Team collaboration
- Impactful projects

I am always open to connecting with like-minded professionals and exploring opportunities for collaboration. Feel free to check out my projects on my profile and reach out to discuss web development, coding, or potential collaborations.
